    <h1 class="headerText">Introduction</h1>
        <p>I was hired to test the vulnerabilities to being hacked of the
            NotUber application, both front and back ends. </p>
    <h1 class="headerText">Methodology</h1>
        <p>I first attempted to infiltrate NotUber with common attacks such as
            cross-site scripting and injection attack.</br>I then examined the
            source code of NotUber to try and identify any potential weaknesses
            that might have been a result of poor programming practices.</br>
            Finally, after identifying a few areas where I saw potential issues,
            I went back to attempting to exploit the potential issues I had
            identified.</p>
    <h1 class="headerText">Abstract Findings</h1>
        <p>The three issues I found most glaring in NotUber were an easily
        exploitable cross-site scripting vulnerability, which means anyone
        could run their own javascript code one the browser of all users who
        tried to use NotUber. Next I found an issue with lack of authentication
        where any person, once they knew another person's username, could change
        the location of that user, whether or not the attacker was signed in
        on the target's account. Lastly, I found a poor programming practice
        which would cause NotUber to crash for all users if exploited. Any user
        can currently claim that their latitude or longitude is something other
        than a number which, when NotUber attempts to render on a map, causes
        the map to crash!</p>
    <h1 class="headerText">Issues Found</h1>
        <h4>Issue 1 - Cross site scripting</h4>
        <p>The issue can be found in the post to /submit path response input
            index.js of the NotUber server. It is an extremely severe issue,
            as it would allow an attacker to run any code on the browser of all
            users who accessed the home path of the NotUber backend app. The
            issue is that the /submit path does not check for special characters
            when one sends a query to it. I found it because I suspected such a
            problem might exist, so I sent a query to /submit with javascript
            code in the body instead of a username.</p>
        <img src="screenshotXSS.png" alt="screenshot of xss">
        <p>This issue could be resolved by removing the special characters from
            the queries sent to /submit. query = query.replace(/[^\w\s]/gi, '');
            would work in the /submit callback for example.</p>
        <h4>Issue 2 - No authentication on /submit post</h4>
        <p>THe issue here is that there is no authentication to ensure that the
            user who sends a post to /submit is actually the user who is logged
            into NotUber. This means that once somebody knows another user's
            username, which isn't generally a secret bit of information, that
            person might change the location of that username. This issue can
            be found in the /submit callback at the call to query the database.
            This is an extremely severe security issue as without any user
            authentication, any person might not only see another user's location,
            but even change it in the NotUber database without needing anything
            but that user's username. I found it by trying to send a submit
            query using a username I knew already had an account with NotUber,
            and seeing whether the location would be changed in the database.</p>
        <img src="screenshotUsernameSubmission.png" alt="screenshot submitting">
        <img src="screenshotUsernameValidation.png" alt="screenshot validating">
        <p>This issue could be resolved by implementing an encrypted password
            for each user. That way NotUber could ensure that the user sending
            location information to the server is indeed the user with permssion
            to do so.</p>
        <h4>Issue 3 - No authentication of query type for latitude or longitude</h4>
            <p>The issue here is that when a submit query is sent to the NotUber
            server, there is no authentication to ensure that the latitude and
            longitude are numbers. This error can be found in the /submit
            callback in the NotUber server. This is an issue of medium severity,
            as it will crash NotUber for all users attempting to use it, however
            it will not give an attacker access to personal information or
            anything of that nature. I found this issue while searching for
            cross site scripting vulnerabilities when I submitted a script in
            the latitude query of a user, and it was submitted to the database
            as the latitude for that user.</p>
            <img src="screenshotAuthenticationError.png" alt="screenshot authentication error">
            <p>This issue could be resolved by using the javascript parseFloat
                method and ensuring that it correctly parsed the query string
                into a floating point number before entering that number into
                the database. var a = parseFloat("10.1") returns 10.1. The method
                also works to parse whole numbers into floats.</p>

    <h1 class="headerText">Conclusion</h1>
        <p>Moving forward with future versions of NotUber I would suggest that
        the developers become extremely weary of user inputs, and to never trust
        that the user will input the queries that would make the app run correctly.
        I would recommend that a team of developers take the time to comb the
        callbacks in the backend of NotUber to ensure that any queries where
        a user might attack the data or functionality of NotUber is prevented.
        While this may slow the further development of NotUber, it would be
        exponentially useful as currently the app is vulnerable to a massive
        security breach.</p>
