Teddy Laurita's private COMP 20 github repo - Spring 2017

This is a repository of a majority of the work I've done in COMP 20 this
semester, including assignments and labs. The most important projects are
"notuber", which is assignment 2 the front end of the NotUber application, and
"security" which is assignment 4, the security analysis of another student's
NotUber application.

My favorite lab/assignment was assignment 3, or the backend of NotUber. I'm
really interested in how one can use a computer to serve a website, and I really
enjoyed working in Node.

I think my understanding of how the web works has grown quite a bit since day
one. Most obviously I've grown in my understanding of what actually happens
when someone accesses a website through a web browser and of some of the basic
security vulnerabilities that exist when one does web programming.

I would say the most important thing I've learned form this course is to never
trust user input. The example of cross site scripting, how often people break
into websites using it, and how easy it is to stop was important for illustrating
his point for me. Secondly injection attacks, and how potentially disastrous
they can potentially be really helped hammer this point home, as a bad one
might reveal all the banking or credit card info of all users of a website.

I would really love to delve deeper into web security, as it's something I think
is really fascinating. Since the security lecture, I've done a little research
into famous hacks, and it's something that seems like it could be a massive
issue in the future, especially because the nature of web programming is constantly
changing.
